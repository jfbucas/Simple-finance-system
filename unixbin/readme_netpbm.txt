These files were built on an up-to-date RedHat Linux 6.2. They are statically
linked and so should run standalone on almost any recent i386 Linux system.
(That's why they're so big!)

These utilities are likely already installed on your system (you can probably
find them in /usr/bin). If, for whatever reason, you can't use the supplied
binaries, you can copy or link your systems version of these utilites to
the assetman/unixbin directory. If all else fails, get the Netpbm source code
and compile these utilities. You don't have to compile the whole Netpbm
distribution, just these utilities. Refer to the Netpbm documentation
for instructions to do this.
