      <h3><a name="about">About Assets & Purchase Order System</a> </h3> 
      <p>Simple Finance System is a complete material management system implemented on a web based platform using a number of Internet technologies. If used as intended, Simple Finance System will enable you to:</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>Maintain a database of capital assets for tracking purposes. Examples of capital assets might include computers, office equipment, office furnishings... any significant asset your company needs to keep tabs on.</li> 
        <li>Maintain a database of items that would not be considered capital assets. These might be spare computer parts, or components of larger units that were purchased separately and have independent warranty / PO / vendor information.</li> 
        <li>Group individual assets together into a configuration assigned to an individual or to a physical location.</li> 
        <li>Find out all sorts of information about any asset or item; when it was purchased, from what vendor and on which purchase order, warranty expiration and so on.</li> 
        <li>Generate and edit purchase orders.</li> 
        <li>Review and edit the status of purchase orders.</li> 
        <li>Receive individual PO line items and add them to either the capital asset or item master databases (or neither if you choose).</li> 
        <li>Generate and edit invoices. You may create invoice line items freeform or you may choose a PO line item to add to your invoice. If you choose the later, AssetMan will track quantities received and invoiced, a feature you may find useful.</li> 
        <li>Printing of invoices and PO's is handled by the web server, there's no need to download the document to the client for printing. The form and the data are generated at print time from a blank form template overlaid with text, so there's no need to order custom pre-printed forms. Good old 8-1/2 X 11 or A4 will do nicely. HTML versions of PO's and Invoices are provided for those who can't or don't want to make use of the advanced printing capabilities of AssetMan.</li> 
        <li>Search for assets, PO's and items with lots of search parameters.</li> 
      </ul> 
      <p>I hope you'll find the user interface intuitive. Check out the other help topics to learn how to use AssetMan effectively.<br>

      <h3><a name="assets">Assets and Items</a></h3> 
      <p>ASSET is what your accountant calls a capital asset or capital equipment. Examples might include a personal computer, a photocopier or a piece of office furniture. Most businesses need to keep track of these assets for accounting purposes.</p> 
      <p>An ITEM, in AssetMan-Speak, is anything you want to keep track of that would not normally be considered a capital asset. Examples might include an inventory of spare parts. An Item could be a component of an Asset but with different purchase / warranty / vendor information. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what is an Asset and what is an Item, keeping in mind that only Assets can be tracked by location / type / vendor etc.</p> 
      <p>Assets are tracked with an asset tag. An asset tag is a small sticker with a unique number on it and any commercial print shop can print them for you. To track an Asset, fix an asset tag to it and pick <b>New > Asset</b> from the menu bar. Complete all the fields and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. If you don't know the PO number, just leave the field blank.</p> 
      <p>Items are tracked by their serial number. To track an Item, pick <b>Items > New</b> from the menu bar, complete all the fields and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. Again, if you don't know the PO number, leave the field blank.</p> 
      <p>You may edit Asset and Item records by picking <b>Edit > Asset</b> or <b>Items > Edit</b> respectively
        from the menu bar. Edit the record as appropriate and click <strong>UPDATE</strong>. You
        may also delete Asset and Item records. If you delete an Asset that is
        a member of a Configuration, then the Configuration will be displayed
        in edit mode so you may update it.<br>

      </br> </br-->
      <hr> 
<!--
      <h3><a name="config">Configurations</a></h3> 
      <p>A Configuration is a grouping of individual Assets. You can group up to 8 Assets into 1 Configuration.</p> 
      <p>Why would you do this? Well, you can use this to assign Assets to a person or location. For example, user Fred has a PC, a monitor and a printer, each of which has its own asset tag. You could create a configuration called Fred and add those 3 asset tags to that configuration. Months later, when you need to know what equipment is assigned to Fred, you can search for Assets that belong to Configuration Fred.</p> 
      <p>To create a new Configuration, pick <b>New > Configuration</b> from the menu bar. Enter up to 8 unique Asset Tags and click <strong>ENTER</strong>.</p> 
      <p>An Asset can belong to only one configuration. AssetMan will prevent you from entering Asset Tags in more than one Configuration.</p> 
      <p>You can edit and delete Configurations by picking <b>Edit > Configuration</b> from
        the menu bar. Deleting a Configuration does not delete the member Assets.<br>

      <h3><a name="equip_types">Equipment Types</a></h3> 
      <p>The Equipment Type dictionary simply stores various classifications for Assets. When you enter a new Asset, you get to choose it's equipment type from a drop menu. The Equipment Type dictionary is where the drop menu contents come from. This also allows you to search for Assets based on Equipment Type.</p> 
      <p>To enter a new Equipment Type, pick <b>New > Equipment Type</b> from the menu bar, enter a descriptive phrase such as "Computer, desktop" and click <strong>ENTER</strong><b>.</b></p> 
      <p>To edit or delete Equipment Type entries, pick <b>Edit > Equipment Type</b> from
        the menu bar. AssetMan will not allow you to delete an Equipment Type
        if there are Asset records which refer to it.<br> 
        <a href="index.html#topics">TOPICS</a></p> 
      <hr> 
      <h3><a name="org">Organizations</a></h3> 
      <p>The Organization dictionary stores name, address and contact information about the various organizational units in your company and/or your customers. The information is used by the Asset tracking functions as well as the PO and Invoice functions of AssetMan. How you use this is up to you, but you could use it to assign Assets to a particular organization. It also comes into play when you create PO's and Invoices, showing up in the Sold To: section.</p> 
      <p>Note that if you check the &quot;Tax Exempt&quot; box, then no sales taxes will be applied to any invoices issued to the organization regardless of whether or not any invoice line items are marked taxable. In other words the &quot;Tax Exempt&quot; box is a sales tax override.</p> 
      <p>You should at least set up your company in the Organization dictionary.</p> 
      <p>To enter a new Organization, pick <b>New > Organization</b> from the
        menu bar, complete all the fields and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. To
        edit or delete Organizations, pick <b>Edit > Organization</b> from the
        menu bar. AssetMan will not allow you to delete an Organization if there
        are Asset, PO or Invoice records which refer to it.<br> 
        <a href="index.html#topics">TOPICS</a></p> 
      <hr> 
      <h3><a name="vendor">Suppliers</a></h3> 
      <p>The Supplier dictionary stores name, address and contact information about all the businesses you purchase from. In order to generate a new PO, the vendor to whom you will issue the PO must exist in the Supplier dictionary first. The Asset and Item dictionaries also refer to the Supplier dictionary so that you can search by Supplier. It is quite important to keep this dictionary up to date as you will surely refer to it often when looking up Supplier contact information.</p> 
      <p>To enter an new Supplier, pick <b>New > Supplier</b> from the menu bar,
        complete all applicable fields and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. To edit
        or delete Suppliers, pick <b>Edit > Supplier</b> from the menu bar. AssetMan
        will not allow you to delete a Supplier if there are Asset or PO records
        which refer to it. <br> 
      <a href="index.html#topics">TOPICS</a></p> 
      <hr> 
      <h3><a name="po">Purchase Orders</a></h3> 
      <p>To create a new Purchase Order, pick <b>PO's > New</b> from the menu bar. The next available PO number is automatically selected and the date is pre-filled with todays date. Select the Supplier to whom the PO is issued and select the appropriate Organization. Click <strong>ENTER</strong> and your blank PO is ready to have line items added to it.</p> 
      <p>Add line items to your PO by clicking <strong>ADD LINE ITEM</strong>. Fill in all the fields and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. When you're finished entering line items and you are not a supervisor, you need to submit your PO for approval. Click <strong>GET APPROVAL</strong>, choose the appropriate supervisor from the drop menu and click <strong>ENTER</strong>. An approval request will be emailed to that supervisor notifying him/her that there is a PO waiting for their approval. You'll get an email notification when your PO is approved so for now, go for coffee. If, on the other hand you are a supervisor, you get the unique privilege of approving your own PO's. Simply click <strong>APPROVE</strong>. Your PO will be approved and no email notifications will be generated.</p> 
      <p>Once approved, the status indicator will change from<img src="../images/open_btn.gif" width="64" height="14">to<img src="../images/appr_open_btn.gif" width="64" height="14">. Also, you may now print the PO by clicking<img src="../images/print_btn.gif" width="64" height="14">. Unless you are a supervisor you may not edit the PO line items any further.</p> 
      <p>As you receive the items on your PO, pick <b>PO's > Edit</b> and enter the PO number. Mark each line as Received by clicking on the <img src="../images/no.png" width="18" height="14"> icon in the <b>Rcv</b> column. You are then given the opportunity to add the item to either the Asset or the Item dictionary or simply mark the item received. Once received, you will notice that the <img src="../images/no.png" width="18" height="14"> icon has changed to a <img src="../images/yes.png" width="18" height="14">.</p> 
      <p>While editing or viewing your PO, you will also notice the <b>Inv</b> field. This field indicates whether or not individual line items have been invoiced to other departments or customers. A <img src="../images/no.png" width="18" height="14"> indicates that this line item has not been invoiced. A <img src="../images/part_yes.png" width="18" height="14"> indicates that only part of the full quantity of this line item has been invoiced. A <img src="../images/yes.png" width="18" height="14"> indicates that the entire quantity of this line item has been invoiced. For more information, refer to the <a href="index.html#inv">Invoices</a> section below.</p> 
      <p>Once you have received all the line items on your PO you should close it by clicking <strong>CLOSE PO</strong>. Once closed, you cannot edit the PO any further and it's only available for viewing. You can't close your PO until all line items have been received.<br> 
        <a href="index.html#topics">TOPICS</a></p> 
      <hr> 
     <h3><a name="inv">Invoices</a></h3> 
      <p>Once you have mastered creating and editing Purchase Orders, you will find creating and editing Invoices almost exactly the same. To create an Invoice pick <b>Invoices > New</b> from the menu bar. The next available invoice number is automatically selected and the date field is pre-filled with todays date. Choose the appropriate Organization and click <strong>ENTER</strong> and you're ready to add lines to your invoice.</p> 
      <p>Click <strong>ADD LINE ITEM</strong> to add lines manually to your invoice. Click <strong>ADD FROM PO</strong> to add a PO line item to your invoice. Select the appropriate PO and then the line item from the lists presented by clicking <img src="../images/select_btn.gif" width="64" height="14">. You might do this if you had purchased something from a vendor with the intention of re-selling it to a customer or another department. If you choose this method, AssetMan will keep track of the number of items you ordered and the number of items you sold. Look in the <b>Inv</b> column of the View/Edit PO page. AssetMan will also automatically apply a price markup if you wish which you can set in <code>config.inc.php</code>.To add comments to your invoice, click <strong>COMMENTS</strong>, type your comments and click <b>ENTER</b>. These comments will appear at the bottom of the invoice when printed.</p> 
      <p>The invoice approval mechanism and status indicators are the same as that described for <a href="index.html#po">PO</a>'s above.</p> 
      <p>Once you are finished editing your invoice, you should close it by clicking <strong>CLOSE INVOICE</strong>. Once closed you cannot edit the invoice any further and it's only available for viewing.<br> 
        <a href="index.html#topics">TOPICS</a></p> 
      <hr> 
      <h3><a name="search">Searching</a></h3> 
      <p>Searching the various data dictionaries is fairly straight forward. Pick <b>Search</b> from the menubar and pick the dictionary you want to search. A search page will appear. At this point, simply choose the search type and enter any other search criteria you want and then click the <strong>SEARCH</strong> button. Your results will be displayed and depending on your search type, you may be able to view more detailed information or edit information in the search result. Just follow the links or the little <img src="../images/view.gif" width="18" height="14"> and <img src="../images/edit.gif" width="18" height="14"> icons and see where they take you! Here's a hint...<img src="../images/view.gif" width="18" height="14"> means view and <img src="../images/edit.gif" width="18" height="14"> means edit. <br>

      <h3><a name="points"></a>Points to Remember</h3> 
      <p>Here's a few pointers to keep in mind while you use AssetMan.</p> 
      <ul> 
        <li>AssetMan is shipped configured for North American style phone numbers.
          If you are doing business internationally or you are located outside
          North America, you may want to &quot;relax&quot; the phone number format
          validation. Check <code>config.inc.php</code> and look for the <code>$cfg[&quot;phone_fmt&quot;]</code> parameter.</li>
        <li>AssetMan is shipped configured for ISO 8601 format dates. You can
          configure the date format for USA or International style formats in
          <code>config.inc.php</code>. Look for the <code>$cfg[&quot;date_fmt&quot;]</code> parameter
          to change the input and output date format. It may be useful to know
          that dates will be stored in the database in ISO format regardless. </li>
        <li>Whenever you encounter a date field, remember that AssetMan expects
          a date in the format you chose at configuration time. AssetMan ususally
          shows you the date format it's expecting from you. Alternatively, you
          can also enter dates in a shortcut format. For example, if you enter
          &quot;-90&quot;, AssetMan will calculate and enter a date equal to today minus
          90 days. Likewise, &quot;+90&quot; is
          today plus 90 days. Date fields left blank usually default to today. </li> 
        <li>Like date fields, the Warranty Expires field in Asset and Item forms
          expects you to enter an appropriately formatted date. You can also
          enter dates in a similar shortcut format. However, the shortcut format
          represents years and the resulting date is calculated from the Recieve
          Date fields. For example, when creating a new asset record you enter
          &quot;2001-06-25&quot; as the receive date, and this asset comes
          with a 5 year warranty. You could enter &quot;+5&quot; and a warranty
          expires value of &quot;2006-06-25&quot; would be calculated.</li> 
        <li>Whenever you enter or update a Configuration, Equipment
          Type, Organization or Supplier, AssetMan will check to make sure the
          first character of the name or type field is a letter or number.
          Not a space or a special character in other words. This is to avoid
          messing up the ordering of some of the drop menus. If AssetMan outputs
          an error saying you must enter a valid name or type, you might want
          to double check that you have no leading spaces or special characters
          in those fields. </li>
      </ul>
